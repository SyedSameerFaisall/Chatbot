## **2. Valuation Analysis**
- **Market Cap**: $3.85 trillion
- **Forward P/E**: 38.35
- **PEG Ratio**: N/A

NVIDIA's high Forward P/E of 38.35 and Price/Sales ratio of 25.94 suggest that the company is valued at a premium compared to its earnings and sales potential. This elevated valuation indicates that the stock may be overvalued relative to historical trends and industry standards, especially considering that the PEG ratio is unavailable, which could have provided further insight into growth expectations relative to valuation. Therefore, from a valuation perspective, NVDA appears overvalued.
